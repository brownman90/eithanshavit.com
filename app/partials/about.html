   <p>My name is Eithan Shavit. I am a Software Engineer at Arista Networks.</p>
   <p>To pass the time that I don't have between work and married life, I create tiny projects. The purpose of these projects is primarily to learn and gain experience in new technologies.</p>
   <p>For instance, I built this simple website using AngularJS, just for learning sake.</p>
   <p>I trained as an Electrical Engineer and was always fascinated about writing software, so some of these projects combine the two worlds.</p>
